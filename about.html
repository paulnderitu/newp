          <p>I used to ask myself that very question until I found myself in Tech. Disclaimer: I am not going to write using the usual lingual and charisma you find in most portfolios today. I am going to tell you exactly what I know about myself, and who
            I know myself to be, and not what I think I am or want.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="col-md-6" <p> My name is Paul Nderitu, an ambitious Kenyan seeking to make in this world by whatever legal means necesarry. I come from a small village in Nyeri, Mathira constituency called Mukore. I am from a family of 7, our parents and 5 children. I am the
          third born. I could start typing here to tell you my story, but believe me, If I started telling it to y'all this would no longer be a portfolio website, but a book. A biography of not less than 500 pages.</p>

      </p>Therefore, I am going to tell you what I know about myself in summmary: I am a very ambitious, hardworking, honest, undertstanding, caring professional who hopes to contribute towards the realization of peace in this world through technology. Hell!
      I believe I could even win the nobel peace price in the near future. But before that, I hope to complete all my clients' project with a unique finish and design in all my tech projects.</p>




      <p>This is my portfolio website, and I hope to expand it to a whole new level. I hope to have it really decorated with achievements in tech and other innovations industry. The combination of my coding skills and my designer eyes make it possible for
